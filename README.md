I never worked on TPOT, and Weixuan who did had a M.S. in animal science lol sad, so he never even took linear algebra like EVER and its filled with bugs as can be seen on its github page

I think all Jason wanted was for me to come back to Penn after I resigned LOL hahaha

# every-post-this-loser-makes-since-2017-is-related-to-me-and-you-especially-about-my-resignation-from-his-shithole_and-its-undergrads-new-to-data-science-that-use-his-bug-filled-software-not-real-scientists

we own this loser btch with no life, like a good percentage of his thought process throughout the day has to do with us, its really funny bc we dont care about him hahaha

i dont go on jasons social media, i feel like its absolutely insane, i just went on it today for like 2 mins, i think this loser btch is beyond insane, i think hes on a lot of medication that gets him up on the morning, he has no plan in life and is deeply depressed, its sad that hes stalking us
