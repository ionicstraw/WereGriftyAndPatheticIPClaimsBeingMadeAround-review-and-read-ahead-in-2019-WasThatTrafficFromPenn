I never worked on TPOT, and Weixuan who did had a M.S. in animal science lol sad, so he never even took linear algebra like EVER and its filled with bugs as can be seen on its github page

I think all Jason wanted was for me to come back to Penn after I resigned LOL hahaha

we own this loser btch with no life, like a good percentage of his thought process throughout the day has to do with us, its really funny bc we dont care about him hahaha
